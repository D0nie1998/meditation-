# Main features

## Header
I designed my website's header to be simple and easy to use, with an intuitive navigation system. This approach can be effective in helping visitors quickly find what they're looking for without getting overwhelmed by a cluttered design. By creating a positive user experience through ease of use and visual clarity, I hope to increase engagement, trust, and conversions.

## Home page
On my website's homepage, I've included an image of a beautiful home in a peaceful setting, with text that highlights how meditation can be done from the comfort of your own home. I believe that this approach can be effective in conveying a sense of peace and relaxation to visitors, while also showcasing the benefits of a consistent meditation practice.

By emphasizing the idea that meditation can be practiced anywhere, including from the comfort of one's own home, I hope to encourage visitors to explore the different meditation resources available on my site

## Introduction
As you browse through my website, you'll notice that I've included a quick and easy-to-understand explanation of what meditation is. With a simple design and easy-to-read font, I've aimed to make this information accessible to everyone, regardless of their level of familiarity with meditation.

## Types of meditation
On my website, I've included a section that explains the four most common types of meditation in a simple and easy-to-understand way. To help create a sense of peace and relaxation, I've used a nice, chill background color that can help induce feelings of happiness and calmness.

## Famous meditators
As part of my website, I've included a section that highlights three famous people who meditate and who I personally look up to: Bill Gates, Michael Jordan, and Oprah Winfrey. Each of these individuals has spoken publicly about how meditation has helped them in different ways, and I believe their stories can be inspiring to others who are curious about the practice.

## About page
On my About page, I've shared a brief personal story about how meditation has affected me in a positive way. Through my own experiences with meditation, I've found that it can help reduce stress and anxiety, improve focus and concentration, and cultivate a greater sense of inner peace and calmness.

I've also included a "Learn More" button on the page, which will take visitors to a free meditation resource that I've created. Through this resource, visitors can access a range of guided meditations and other tools to help them get started with meditation, regardless of their level of experience.

## Contact page 
On my Contact page, I've provided visitors with the opportunity to send me a message with any questions or comments they may have about meditation or my website. I believe that creating an open and accessible space for dialogue and discussion is an important part of building a supportive community around meditation.

To help create a sense of calm and relaxation on the page, I've also included a photo that is designed to be soothing and peaceful. This photo is intended to represent a key aspect of the meditation practice, which involves cultivating a sense of inner stillness and calmness even amidst the busyness of daily life.

## Future development
As my website continues to evolve and grow, there are a number of features and resources that I hope to add in the future. One of the top items on my list is creating videos that provide a more immersive and interactive experience for visitors to the site.

Through these videos, I hope to offer guided meditations and other instructional content that can help people deepen their practice and develop greater mindfulness and awareness in their daily lives. Whether you're a beginner or more experienced meditator, I believe that having access to high-quality instructional content can be incredibly helpful in achieving your meditation goals.

In addition to videos, I'm also interested in creating a blog that provides a space for like-minded people to connect, share ideas, and discuss their experiences with meditation and mindfulness. By building a community of supportive and engaged individuals, I believe that we can create a more dynamic and rewarding meditation practice for everyone involved.

Ultimately, my goal is to continue expanding the range of resources and tools available on my website, so that everyone who is interested in meditation has access to the information and support they need to succeed. Whether you're just starting out or have been practicing for years, I believe that there is always something new to learn and discover when it comes to meditation and mindfulness, and I look forward to continuing this journey with you.

# Testing

## Validation

### HTML 
I'm happy to report that after careful testing and validation, all three of the HTML pages on my website are free of errors and issues. I took great care to ensure that all of the code was properly formatted, that all of the tags were closed and nested correctly, and that there were no typos or other errors that could impact the functionality of the site.

By validating my HTML code, I was able to ensure that the pages on my site are fully accessible and compatible with a wide range of devices and web browsers. This means that anyone who visits my site can enjoy a seamless and intuitive experience, without having to worry about technical issues or other problems that could detract from their enjoyment of the content.

### CSS
I wanted to ensure that my website's CSS code was as error-free as possible, so I decided to use a program called Jigsaw to test it out. Jigsaw is a powerful tool that can help detect any issues with CSS code, and I found it to be an incredibly useful resource in ensuring the quality of my site.

After running my CSS code through Jigsaw, I'm happy to report that there were no errors detected. This means that the formatting and syntax of my CSS is up to standard and that my website should display properly across all browsers and devices.

## Error
I encountered an issue with my media queries. I was trying to adjust the layout of my page for different screen sizes, but I was struggling to fill out the page in a way that looked good and balanced.When I tried to adjust the layout by adding more content, I noticed that the footer would appear in the middle of the page on certain screen sizes, which was not ideal. I tried a few different solutions, but nothing seemed to work.

After doing some research and consulting with some online resources, I realized that the issue was related to the way I was structuring my HTML and CSS. I needed to make sure that my HTML was structured in a way that allowed for a fluid layout, and that my CSS was properly organized and optimized for different screen sizes.

To fix the issue, I first restructured my HTML to create a more flexible layout, and then adjusted my CSS to properly handle different screen sizes. I also made sure to use responsive design techniques, such as using percentage-based units for widths and heights, and adding breakpoints for different screen sizes.

After making these changes, I was able to properly fill out my page and ensure that the footer remained at the bottom of the page on all screen sizes. Overall, I learned that proper HTML structure and optimized CSS are key to creating a responsive and balanced layout for a web development project.


## Bugs

As I was working on my web development project, I took care to thoroughly test my code and ensure that it was free of bugs and errors. I ran various tests on different browsers and devices to make sure that my website was functioning properly and that all features were working as intended.

After conducting my tests, I was pleased to discover that there were no bugs or errors present in my code. All of the features were working as intended and the website was functioning smoothly on different browsers and devices.

Of course, this doesn't mean that my website was perfect or couldn't be improved in some way. There's always room for optimization and further development, but the absence of bugs and errors was a good indication that my code was sound and that I had taken the necessary steps to ensure that my website was functioning as intended.

## Lighthouse
I used the Chrome extension Lighthouse to test the performance, accessibility, and best practices of my web page. The results were outstanding as Lighthouse gave my page a 80% pass rate in all departments. This showed that the page was well optimized for speed, user experience, and accessibility, which are all important factors for creating a successful website. Lighthouse provided a comprehensive report of the testing, allowing me to identify any potential issues and make improvements where necessary. I was very satisfied with the results and confident that my website was ready to provide a positive user experience to all visitors.

## Multiple-browser testing
To ensure the best possible user experience, I tested the website on multiple browsers including Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and Safari. I was pleased to find that the website displayed correctly on all of these browsers and there were no issues with the responsive design. This rigorous testing process ensured that the website could be accessed and used by a wide range of users, regardless of their preferred browser.
